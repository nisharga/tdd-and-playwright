# Playwright Course Project

A comprehensive Playwright testing course with multiple modules covering different aspects of end-to-end testing, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. 

## Project Structure

The workspace contains several modules, each focusing on different aspects of Playwright testing:

### üìÅ **First/** - Basic Introduction
Getting started with Playwright fundamentals
- Basic test structure and syntax
- Fixtures and browser automation
- First.spec.ts - Introduction to heading verification
- example.spec.ts - Basic navigation and assertions
- Fixtures.spec.ts - Understanding fixtures and browser contexts

### üìÅ **Starter/** - Core Concepts & Local Testing
Comprehensive testing of a local web application with various interaction patterns
- **Local Server**: Express.js server serving static HTML pages
- **Test Categories**:
  - **Locators**: Different ways to find elements (tests/locators/)
  - **Actions**: User interactions like filling forms, clicking, selecting (tests/actions/)
  - **Configuration**: Test setup, hooks, annotations (tests/configure/)
  - **Practice**: Real-world form testing scenarios (tests/practice/)

### üìÅ **valentino-magic-beans/** - Production E2E Testing
Complete e-commerce testing suite with authentication, API interception, and email integration
- **Features**:
  - User authentication flow with email verification
  - Product catalog and shopping cart functionality  
  - Complete checkout process with payment
  - Order tracking and contact forms
  - API request interception and mocking
- **Key Files**:
  - product-flow.spec.ts - End-to-end purchase workflow
  - auth-flow.spec.ts - User registration with email verification
  - EmailUtils.ts - Email testing with MailSlurp integration
  - Page Objects for modular test organization

### üìÅ **Info/** - Asynchronous JavaScript Concepts
Educational examples demonstrating async programming patterns
- 1Simple.js - Synchronous operations
- 2Service.js - Promise-based services
- 3CallBack.js - Callback patterns  
- 4AsyncAwait.js - Modern async/await syntax

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (22+ recommended for latest features)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Setup

1. **Install Playwright browsers** (run once):
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

2. **Set up individual modules**:

   **For Starter module**:
   ```bash
   cd Starter
   npm install
   npm start  # Starts local server at http://localhost:5000
   ```

   **For valentino-magic-beans module**:
   ```bash
   cd valentino-magic-beans
   npm install
   # Optional: Set MAIL_SLURP_API_KEY for email tests
   ```

## üß™ Running Tests

### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests in a module
npx playwright test

# Run with browser visible
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/basic/Cart.spec.ts

# Run tests with specific tag
npx playwright test --grep @Field
```

### Module-Specific Commands

**Starter Module**:
```bash
cd Starter
npx playwright test                    # Run all tests
npx playwright test tests/locators/    # Test locator strategies
npx playwright test tests/actions/     # Test user interactions
```

**valentino-magic-beans Module**:
```bash
cd valentino-magic-beans
npx playwright test                    # Run all tests
npx playwright test --project=chromium # Run specific browser
npx playwright test auth-flow.spec.ts  # Test authentication
```

### Advanced Testing Features

**Authentication Setup**:
```bash
# Generate authentication credentials (valentino-magic-beans)
SIGN_UP_FLOW=true npx playwright test auth-flow.spec.ts
```

**Device Emulation**:
```bash
# Test mobile viewport
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"
```

**Debug Mode**:
```bash
# Step through tests interactively
npx playwright test --debug
```

## üìä Test Reports

**View HTML Report**:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

**Generate and Open Report**:
```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Testing Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. **Locator Strategies**
- `getByRole()` - Semantic element selection
- `getByTestId()` - Data attribute targeting  
- `getByText()` - Content-based selection
- `getByLabel()` - Form field identification
- CSS and XPath selectors

### 2. **User Interactions**
- Form filling and validation
- File uploads and downloads
- Drag and drop operations
- Keyboard and mouse events
- Mobile gestures

### 3. **Advanced Features**
- API request interception and mocking
- Browser storage manipulation
- Cookie and session handling
- Email verification workflows
- Multi-page application testing

### 4. **Test Organization**
- Page Object Model implementation
- Test fixtures and hooks
- Parameterized testing
- Test tags and filtering
- Parallel execution strategies

## üìö Learning Path

1. **Start with First/**: Basic Playwright concepts
2. **Progress to Starter/**: Interactive testing with local app  
3. **Advanced with valentino-magic-beans/**: Production-ready e2e testing
4. **Study Info/**: Understanding async JavaScript patterns

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new tests:
- Follow the established Page Object pattern
- Add appropriate test tags for filtering
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Document any external dependencies or setup requirements

## üìû Support

- **Playwright Documentation**: https://playwright.dev/
- **Test Examples**: Check the various `*.spec.ts` files for patterns
- **Local Development**: Use `--headed` and `--debug` flags for troubleshooting
